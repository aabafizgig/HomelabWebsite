                I started today's ventures by installing a VM for this web server that this site is hosted on.    
                I used Ubuntu Server as the base image and configured it with Nginx and SSH.
                This process was smooth and straightforward.

                I downloaded Rufus and the Ubuntu ISO to create a bootable drive to use on the OptiPlex I acquired. 
                I plan to install pfSense on it to use as a dedicated machine for my network-wide firewall later, but I wanted something other than Windows 7.

                I received some of the cables I ordered today: Cat 6 Ethernet cables, a VGA cable that it turns out I did not need right now, but it is always good to have a spare on the shelf,
                or in the box, if you're like myself.

                I also took time to put Windows 11 Pro on my laptop. It really did not like Windows 10 Home. It seems to be running quite a bit better now.
                I am going to try to install VirtualBox on it so I can practice some stuff when I am away from home. That was a bit of a hassle.
                Since it was a Windows Home edition, I had to write a few files and put them into the bootable USB I made so that Windows Installer would
                ignore the Home edition Registry Key that was in the laptop's BIOS.
