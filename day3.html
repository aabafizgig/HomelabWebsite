            I started today's ventures by installing a VM for this web server that this site is hosted on.    
            I used Ubuntu Server as the base image and configured it with Nginx and SSH.
            This process was smooth and straightforward.

            I downloaded Rufus and the Ubuntu ISO to create a bootable drive to use on the OptiPlex I acquired. 
            I plan to install pfSense on it to use as a dedicated machine for my network-wide firewall later, but I wanted something other than Windows 7.

            I received some of the cables I ordered today: Cat 6 Ethernet cables, a VGA cable that it turns out I did not need right now, but it is always good to have a spare on the shelf,
            or in the box, if you're like myself.

            I also took time to put Windows 11 Pro on my laptop. It really did not like Windows 10 Home. It seems to be running quite a bit better now.
            I am going to try to install VirtualBox on it so I can practice some stuff when I am away from home. That was a bit of a hassle.
            Since it was a  Windows Home edition. I had to write a few files and put them into the bootable USB I made. So that Windows Installer would
            ignore the Home edition Registry Key that was in the laptops BIOS.
