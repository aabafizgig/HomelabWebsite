        <h1>Day 2</h1>

        <p>
            Today I acquired an Optiplex that I will eventually use for my pfSense machine. 
            It will run "Bare Metal" and act as my network’s firewall. 
            I need to get a network card for it so it can pass the connection through itself, from what I understand.
        </p>

        <p>
            On another note, I installed another VM and set up Pi-Hole to manage my network’s DNS. 
            I originally configured it to run network-wide through my router (TP-Link AXE750), 
            but I have concerns about the gaming consoles on the network. 
            For now, I set the DNS on all my machines to the VM’s local IP and configured the secondary DNS as Google’s 8.8.8.8 just in case.
        </p>

            After I figured that out, I set up a VM running Home Assistant. 
            I created two user accounts and added a few of my home devices, including the living room TV. 
            Now I no longer have to shout to turn it down from the PC, I can just open the browser and control it myself.

        <p>
            I continued working and assigned both VMs their own IP addresses. 
            I even successfully pinged each one from the other.
