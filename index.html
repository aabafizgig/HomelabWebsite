        <h1>Homelab Journal</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my homelab journey! This is my day by day journey of building my Homelab and improving our home network.
            Follow along as I document my progress, challenges, and solutions. I have begun my home lab with a focus on virtualization and network management.
            I have interest in Hosting Game servers. Which lead me down the rabbit hole of learning about virtualization, networking, and server management.
            
            I have started with a Retired Dell workstation, which I will use to run various virtual machines for different purposes along with my game servers.
